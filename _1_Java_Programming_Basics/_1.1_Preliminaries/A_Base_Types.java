 * public: This says anyone can run this program
 * class: All code in a Java program must belong to a class
 * A_Base_Types: The name of this class
 * static: This method belong to the class, not an object (more on later)
 * void: This method doesn't return anything
 * main: Method where program begins
 * String[] args: Parameters passed to this method
 * System.out.println: The name of the method we want to call(in this case the method for printing strings on the screen)
 * 
 * Reserved Words: There are 33 reversed words in Java are:-
